This project was my attempt to put into practice the information learned from a Pluralsight course from Cory House [Building Applications with React and Flux](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-flux-building-applications).

This is a simple react/flux todo app that allows you to add, remove and mark to do's. It uses json-server to handle api calls locally. It also uses tailwindscss for styling.

## To Run the App

- run npm install
- run npm start

**[npm start] will run compile the tailwinds config, run the local api server and serve up the react app up at: http://localhost:3000**
